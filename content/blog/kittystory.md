I wanted to do something different for my latest book. I wanted to do a joint work with my brother, Felix, so I wrote a book about his stuff cat, Kitty. Felix came up with with Kitty's story about Cat Planet. It was natural for me to write down the story and then have Felix color in the pictures. This was a fun collaboration, and weâ€™re already planning the next book in the series. I hope you enjoy [Kitty's Story](https://kitty-story.netlify.com/), the first book in a new series about Kitty.

Felix did all the coloring for [Kitty's Story](https://kitty-story.netlify.com/). Listen to his experiences producing the artwork.
