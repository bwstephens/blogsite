[The Final War](https://finalwar.netlify.com/) is a book about my adventures in a video game named Minecraft. It's a story about me and my friends who fight against the evil Herobrine. It has many surprises along the way, and comes to an exciting conclusion. I loved authoring and illustrating [The Final War](https://finalwar.netlify.com/), my first book.

Beckett has always written down his stories, but when he found out that he could add one to the school library he got really excited about publishing a book. [The Final War](https://finalwar.netlify.com/) is book two in a three part series. Beckett hopes you'll enjoy all of his books.  

### Making the Book

[The Final War](https://finalwar.netlify.com/) was written and illustrated by hand. Then it was transcribed and edited digitally. The book was rendered into HTML and PDF using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), a package part of the [R software environment](https://www.r-project.org/). The book was finally published to [Netflify](https://www.netlify.com/), a content delivery network based on code. The process of creating and publishing [The Final War](https://finalwar.netlify.com/) involved the whole family, but the story and pictures remain solely Beckett's work and imagination.
