Book 2 was an awesome experience. It was so fun to share the book online and with everyone at my school. My family and friends have been encouraging me to write book 3. Today I am announcing the completion of the manuscript for book 3, *King Ghast's Revenge*. Here's a preview:

> King Ghast is going to be emperor for most of the book. It's a little creepier than book 2. This is a mystery about Herobrine coming back, and it starts with a ghost. 

Today I sent book 3 to my editor -- my Mom -- for review. I am excited to have the book published online soon. 

I also want to announce that I have begun work on book 4! Thanks to all my readers!
